# Using the io package


## Defer

"Defer is used to ensure that a function call is performed later in a program's execution..."

When `defer` is called, it sets the "deferred" function to be executed at the end of the enclosing
function.

## io.ReadSeeker

ReadSeeker combines the Reader and Seeker interfaces, allowing a file (or stream) to be read
and searched at the same time.
