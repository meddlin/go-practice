# Maps

Maps are Go's associative data type. They are commonly used to store key-value pairs.

Setting them up, they follow this pattern:

```go
make(map[key-type]val-type)

/*
 * A map where the key is a string, and the value is a string
 * -- similar to JSON -- would look like this.
*/
make(map[string]string)
```
