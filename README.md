A collection of practicing exercises I walked through while learning Go.


## Notes

Organizing work for this repo is deisgned to be "one exercise per directory". However, this means we need to configure this to be "one module per directory". This effectively means we have a single repo with multiple modules. *To work with multiple modules, we need to make use of a Go workspace.*
